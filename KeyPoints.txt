History
Procedural Programming - Programs are sequences of instructions to be executed.
						 Where the program is split up into named sets of instructions called procedures (analogous to functions)
	1.  Groups of procedures/functions were grouped into files, generally named Modules
	2.  Grouping was solely based upon the discretion of the developer.
		Procedures did not need to have any of relevance to be placed/grouped into the same Module.
	3.	All procedures were static and global in nature
		This was because any procedure can invoke any other procedure


Object Oriented Programing - Programs are based on the concept of "Objects" which contain data and code.
	1.	Data is in the form of fields or attributes
	2.	Code is in the form of procedures/functions
	3.	There is a direct relevance between the data and the code.
OOP Languague must support the following
	1.	Polymorphism
	2.	Inheritence
	3.	Encapsulation
		a.  Data and Code are encapsulated within a self contained definition such that the Code can reference the Data without relying on an external
			entity to supply the arguments.
